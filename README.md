# VG101 H8

All of the mandatory exercises have been completed:

	- ex1

	- ex2

	- ex3

# Getting Started

To run the project, compile the project using the following command:

g++ main.cpp ex2.cpp ex3.cpp circle.cpp triangle.cpp parallelogram.cpp trapezium.cpp car.cpp shape.cpp -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -Wno-unused-result -O2 -lglut -lGL -lGLU -lm

Then run the output file and select the right exercise.

# Expected input

Ex1 is written according to JOJ requirements. It requires a sentence of input and will either reverse it, or print it in the regular order. Before this will happen, a function will have to be called from the main (ex1()) function.

Ex2 & Ex3 do not expect any input.

# Known bugs

There are no known bugs. Ex1 is tested on JOJ and passes 6/6 cases. The code for ex1 is quite redundant and not very clean, but it does meet all of the requirements for JOJ.

# Written by
